## Crafting Rails 4 Applications by Jos√© Valim
### Just because you finished Hartl's book doesn't mean your learning is even close to being over!

Between studying the ruby language proper and learning the fundamentals of Rails, I felt I was missing that next place to go after going through Michael Hartl's amazing book on rails. Well to me more specific, I went through Hartl's book three times and went through the authentication/authorization portion 6+ times. My goal with latter was to be able to roll my own authentication/authorization system without needing to reference the book. It's one thing to memorize the steps, it's another thing completely to truly understand the steps. I won't lie and state that I truly know every part, but I'd like to think I'm making great progress in that area.

There are several different rails plugins "Crafting Rails 4 Applications" takes you as a why to fully explain the core concepts behind Rails. This Readme will serve as a checklist of where I am at any given time in this book.
